# This script emulates a Kubernetes shutdown signalling sequence for background-worker.
# NOTE: It will send signals to any currently running process called "background-work"

# Testing setup
# This script was written for the following testing methodology.
# All commands are from the wire-server repo root unless otherwise noted.
# 1) Setup local databases. `docker-compose -f deploy/dockerephemeral/docker-compose.yaml build && ./deploy/dockerephemeral/run.sh`
# 2) Run Wire services. `make cr`
# 2) Kill the running background-worker services. `pkill -9 background-work`
# 3) From the `services/background-worker` directory, run the service with the integration config. `cabal run background-worker -- -c background-worker.integration.yaml`
# 4) Run the `fill_rabbit.sh` script with the desired message.
# 5) Run this script and ensure that background worker exits gracefully.
