New config value
`background-worker.backendNotificationPusher.remotesRefreshIntervalMs`.
If in doubt, set to 30000 ms.  (This controls the delay between
backend-to-backend notification queue update pulls from rabbitMQ to
background-worker.)

If you have enabled federation and therefore rabbitMQ before this
upgrade, you should remove all queues called
`backend-notifications.delete-federation` manually.

Remote federation domains in the config file are no longer supported.
Before deploying this release, make sure you have completed the
migration steps from [the CHANGELOG of Chart Release 4.36.0 (search
for "remote connections can be configured via an internal REST
API")](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server/releases/tag/v2023-08-11).
